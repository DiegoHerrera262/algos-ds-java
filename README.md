This repo is a documentation of the process of learning algorithms and datastructures with java

## How to contribute

Although java is a OOP language, it is encouraged to limit the solutions to using functional programming patterns. Those may include:

* Recursion
* Higher order functions (lambdas)
* Streams / iterables for processing sequences (whenever possible)
* Avoid state mutation as much as possible

Also, it is required that each class for a problem solution has both unit and property tests. Unit tests are managed using JUnit 5, whereas property testing is managed using jqwik.
